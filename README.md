Hey folks. I’ve created an expense tracker which searches your email and records your personal expenses into a google sheet automatically based on the email transaction alerts sent by banks. I’ve been using for the the last one year and it’s been useful to make me aware of any avenues of overspending etc and also to keep a check on lifestyle inflation over time.
Please reach out to me if you are interested to set this up for yourself. Shouldn’t take more than 5 min.
PS: Currently only works on few banks credit cards (hdfc, icici, axis, idfc, citi) and upi (hdfc, axis). More cards/upi can be added.
